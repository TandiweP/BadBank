Project Title: Bad Bank 

Description: Banking application that allows users to create accounts and manage withdrawals and deposits.  It also tracks data for all users. Although there is account verification, security is currently lacking. 

Installation Guidelines: Fork and clone to your local machine.  To run, spin up a server.

Technology used: HTML, CSS, JS, JSX, React, Babel, Bootstrap, Unsplash

Future Improvements/Features: I am currently converting this project to utilize Node.js, MongoDB, and Express (in addition to React and Bootstrap). The app functions and the routing is complete, but I am working to integrate security features and change some of the UI.
